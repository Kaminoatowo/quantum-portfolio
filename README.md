# Quantum Computing Foundations

## Overview

This repository provides a **rigorous and hands-on introduction to the foundations
of quantum computing**, combining:

- formal theoretical background,
- explicit circuit implementations,
- simulation-based experiments using Python.

The project is designed as the **first building block** of a broader
quantum computing portfolio, with a focus on **theoretical understanding
and algorithmic correctness**, rather than black-box usage.

All implementations are kept **small, explicit, and inspectable**.

## Objectives

The main goals of this repository are:

- develop a **clear understanding of quantum states, gates, and measurements**
- implement **fundamental quantum circuits and algorithms from scratch**
- connect mathematical formalism with executable simulations
- build a solid base for advanced topics (VQE, QAOA, noise, quantum simulation)
